[Video Description: 
 <br>   
A video is taken of a steel-colored Great Dane, named Lars, sitting on a light blue chair. The owner, Teegan, speaks in the background as if she is Lars talking in the first person. 
<br>
<br>
The camera shows Lars sitting with his hind legs on the chair and his two front legs touching the floor.<br>
Teegan speaking for Lars behind the camera: “Hi, my name is Lars. This is my favorite chair in the house. My family members call it Lar’s chair.”
<br><br>
Teegan reaches for Lar’s chin. Teegan scratches his chin and shows the camera his lips. 
<br><br>
Teegan speaking for Lars behind the camera: “I’m a big fan of chin scratches and I have very big lips!”
<br><br>
Teegan reaches to scratch Lar’s ear. Teegan speaking for Lars: “And I also like behind the ear. And I’m currently upset because Mom hasn’t taken me for a walk yet (insert annoyed face).” 
<br><br>
The camera cuts to show Lar’s entire body sitting on the chair. Teegan reaches her hand out to Lars. Teegan speaking for Lars: “And I can normally do a trick.” 
<br><br>
Teegan, behind the camera: “Come, give me your paw! 
<br><br>
